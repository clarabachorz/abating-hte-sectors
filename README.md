- The IEA_data_analysis folder is used to extract the total energy end-use by sector and corresponding emissions. It will be used for the background of the MACC figures
- The technoeconomic folder contains code developed to calculate technoeconomic data (eg. LCOs and FSCP) from a large excel file. Most of this work should and would be recycled for the POSTED database
- The analysis folder contains a python script, which build the figures. This code will use the IEA data, but separate technoeconomic data (found in tech_assumptions)
